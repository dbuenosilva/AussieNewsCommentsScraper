Most people would stay home even if a few disobey. Statistically it would reduce the odds of a community outbreak compared to our current situation.

of men, thus making them less attractive to men. This preposterous doctor also wrote a book to which I say, before you can write this book you need to write one titled A Sense. Then, you need to take a person through and ask, ""How to you describe yourself?"" ""What aspects of your self are most important?"" ""How do you define yourself?"" Let's take a complex example: Shane Porteous as Dr Terence Elliot. Shane Porteous is an artist in real life; and this shows in his character. Dr Terence Elliot is not a real doctor, but an aspect of his character is a hobby artist. So, if you're a doctor, lawyer, teacher or what have you, and you like art, music or whatever, it is important that you take time out to partake in your hobby for your mental health.

Keep records that you are doing enough of exactly what the government request...then make as many highly speculative shot-in-the-dar
k job applications as you want on top of that.

history is pock-marked with accounts of the best of us, the worst of us, as people

it is well said all behaviour will fall to the level of the lowest common denominator

this is why we see riots; why we see ‚Äòmob rules‚Äô; why we see so much angst in divisiveness

seems to me, differences in religious zealotry are a major cause of evil being visited by one group on another

I wonder at times about survivors ... a blessing they are alive to share their story - but surely, they are cursed in trying to live with those same memories

when I stop and think of the lineal history of mankind, the way points of navigation are most readily grasped, as the times of atrocities and resultant heinous acts - shame

I close

This is what the colonizer Jacob said to the owners of the houses in Sheikh Jarrah when he expelled them from it, watch the link below and you will understand the whole story

What if someone occupied your house and your land and expelled you from it? What would you do? Surely you will res/ist him in all ways, this is what the Pales/tinians do

There is a difference between resi%stance and ter=rorism, and a ter&rorist is someone who oc&cupies your land and your home

Could you please mention to me the number of dead and wounded on both sides since the beginning of the events? I think that the victims of the Pale=stinians are more than 30 times the victims of the other side

Did you know that there is an aparth&eid wall in Pales./tine, pevint them from traviling and that they are prohibited from building in Jeru%salem?its like a big cage

the reason for the renewed clashes is the attaack on the Muslim Mo&osque in Jerus@alem, and the expulsion of residents from their homes in the Sheikh Garah area in jeru@salem(watc
h the conversation in the vidio below)

do you know that the residents of Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood were originally refugees and were expelled from their homes in Lydda, Haifa and Jaffa during the 1947 war, and they are not allowed to return back to thier home in 1947 lands borders, and now they are fhreaged to expelled foe another time.

Well, return them back to their original homes that were stolen from them and turned into refugees after being expelled.

Will the other side allowed them returning it to their original homes in the lands of 1947?

The Pales#tinians have agreed to the two-state solution of 1967 border .even though it rubs them of more than 50‚Ä∞ of their historical borders, The question is, where is their state? and whether Isr%ael agreed to implement this solution agreement???

Stop falsify and change the facts,

The question is whether Isr#ael agreed to the 1967 borders, to agreed the two-state solution, or to the return of even a small portion of those who were forcibly displaced from their homes and inhabited by people who came from Europe, America, Russia and Africa, where is the Pales&tinians' rights to self-determinat
ion

The Pales&tinians have recognized the state of Is#rael since 1993 in the hope that they will establish thier state. Did they allowed them to do so, or did it recognize their rights to establish a state? The answer is NO

What was the result?? the settlements Did not stoped, and the displacement them from their homes and their demolition and seizure of settlements and settlements continued even after they signed an agreement since 30 years ago, and the fear that there will not be any land lefted for negotiations and agreement on it has been completed Completely confiscated,

The other side is one who wants the whole cake

Stop falsify a change of the truth and double standards , and it is not allowed to equate the perpetrator with the victims anymore

Their victomes is more than 30 times of the other side victomes, most of them are children, you can't compair homemade weapo#ns with air#crafts, planes, tan#ks and organized arm/y

A people whose land, water, and house have been stolen and expelled from their home#land, they have the right to res#ist. Do not blame them for their reaction, but blame those who caused this and made their pains

I think it is time for the Pale#stinians to get their rights and their state

Stop your humman right double standerds

This videos sum up the pales-tinian justic

They were expelled from their land in 1947, and the matter was repeated in the 1967 war, and an apartheid wall was built, and their lands are confiscated on a daily basis.

The most recent of them is the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, which has caused recent events and violence , as they are currently being expelled from their homes in which they and their build and lived Dozens of years agoÿå to Let settlers live in their place from countries of the world

This is what the colonizer Jacob said to the owners of the houses in Sheikh Jarrah when he expelled them from it, watch the link below and you will understand the whole story

What if someone occupied your house and your land and expelled you from it? What would you do? Surely you will res/ist him in all ways, this is what the Pales/tinians do

There is a difference between resi%stance and ter=rorism, and a ter&rorist is someone who oc&cupies your land and your home

Could you please mention to me the number of dead and wounded on both sides since the beginning of the events? I think that the victims of the Pale=stinians are more than 30 times the victims of the other side

Did you know that there is an aparth&eid wall in Pales./tine, pevint them from traviling and that they are prohibited from building in Jeru%salem?its like a big cage

the reason for the renewed clashes is the attaack on the Muslim Mo&osque in Jerus@alem, and the expulsion of residents from their homes in the Sheikh Garah area in jeru@salem(watc
h the conversation in the vidio below)

do you know that the residents of Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood were originally refugees and were expelled from their homes in Lydda, Haifa and Jaffa during the 1947 war, and they are not allowed to return back to thier home in 1947 lands borders, and now they are fhreaged to expelled foe another time.

Well, return them back to their original homes that were stolen from them and turned into refugees after being expelled.

Will the other side allowed them returning it to their original homes in the lands of 1947?

The Pales#tinians have agreed to the two-state solution of 1967 border .even though it rubs them of more than 50‚Ä∞ of their historical borders, The question is, where is their state? and whether Isr%ael agreed to implement this solution agreement???

Stop falsify and change the facts,

The question is whether Isr#ael agreed to the 1967 borders, to agreed the two-state solution, or to the return of even a small portion of those who were forcibly displaced from their homes and inhabited by people who came from Europe, America, Russia and Africa, where is the Pales&tinians' rights to self-determinat
ion

The Pales&tinians have recognized the state of Is#rael since 1993 in the hope that they will establish thier state. Did they allowed them to do so, or did it recognize their rights to establish a state? The answer is NO

What was the result?? the settlements Did not stoped, and the displacement them from their homes and their demolition and seizure of settlements and settlements continued even after they signed an agreement since 30 years ago, and the fear that there will not be any land lefted for negotiations and agreement on it has been completed Completely confiscated,

The other side is one who wants the whole cake

Stop falsify a change of the truth and double standards , and it is not allowed to equate the perpetrator with the victims anymore

Their victomes is more than 30 times of the other side victomes, most of them are children, you can't compair homemade weapo#ns with air#crafts, planes, tan#ks and organized arm/y

A people whose land, water, and house have been stolen and expelled from their home#land, they have the right to res#ist. Do not blame them for their reaction, but blame those who caused this and made their pains

I think it is time for the Pale#stinians to get their rights and their state

Stop your humman right double standerds

This videos sum up the pales-tinian justic

They were expelled from their land in 1947, and the matter was repeated in the 1967 war, and an apartheid wall was built, and their lands are confiscated on a daily basis.

The most recent of them is the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, which has caused recent events and violence , as they are currently being expelled from their homes in which they and their build and lived Dozens of years agoÿå to Let settlers live in their place from countries of the world
