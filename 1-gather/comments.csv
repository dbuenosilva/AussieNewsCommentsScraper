REMEMBER that ""hesitating"" is what you do before choosing to jump off a two-storey building that is engulfed in flames - it's nothing like choosing a medically-appro
ved vaccine that is already in common use all around the world.
REMEMBER to re-elect the Prime Minister who downplayed the urgency of Australia's vaccination roll-out by saying it was ""not a race or a competition” (when he had barely moved off the starting line).
REMEMBER to vote for the federal government that kept denying the obvious need to build new quarantine facilities while instead racking up $1 trillion in public debt to ward off the pandemic's crippling financial effects.
REMEMBER to swallow the spin from a government that pulled up the drawbridge against thousands of our fellow citizens (because the Commonwealth still hadn't built a quarantine system to be able to safely bring Aussies home without infecting the rest of us ... so they/we cut them loose to fend for themselves in foreign lands like the plot of a disturbing zombie movie).
REMEMBER Liberal Health Minister Greg Hunt who encouraged over-50s to take the locally-produce
d AstraZeneca vaccine ""as early as possible"" yet immediately added: ""But we’ve been very clear that, as supply increases later on in the year, there will be enough vaccine of mRNA vaccines for every Australian"" (referring to Pfizer and Moderna imports expected later this year).

There you go, easy, peasy - just go to Centrelink, probs won’t be eligible, but line yourself up & ask someone who knows, because the government doesn’t.
Have we ever had a government so totally clueless on how anything works in the real world?

Then as soon as he's gone Biden's like yeah there might be something there (and when I say Biden I mean he's handlers)
And previous to this anyone who thought the lab leak was a credible theory was labelled a conspiracy theorist.
Do you remember that ABC some of us do?
It's funny watching faucci and co start to squirm when asked difficult questions like did the NIH directly fund gain of function testing on corona viruses in you know Wuhan.
Makes you think as much as we wanted answers because of politics there was mass obfuscation with a theory that was the most logical and you and 90% of the media towed that line.
And gave legitimacy to the tin foil hat brigade that were proposing this theory a year ago.

Melbourne peeps if you’re complaining about lock down read this

This is what has happened in melbourne and why we are in lock down.

A guy walks in to a Melbourne bar - he’s just back from India, does 14 days quarantine in Adelaide, passes that and wanders the streets of Adelaide then flys to Melbourne AND THEN the virus that was on him all that time suddenly appears and starts spreading, and causes the complete lockdown of 6.5 million people for at least 7 days.

No one else in Adelaide quarantine or working there, no one else in Adelaide, no one else on the plane gets it.

But he gets to Melbourne and SHAZAM, it takes off and shuts the whole state down.

And all this happens days before the State of Emergency runs out in Victoria.

And the reason for a lockdown, according to the govt, is that not enough people are “jabbed”.

But they get to extend the State of Emergency because of this sudden and mysterious outbreak that only happened AFTER the guy left quarantine and flew to Melbourne and mixed amongst his family.

And the people of Victoria rush out in unprecedented numbers to join the global human testing and trial of a toxic concoction currently being marketed by govt as a ‘ennicav’ - even though it’s not actually a ‘ennicav’ and even with the long term ramifications will not being known for a long time, of course.

And no one questions it.

As a country, the move to only EV's (or clean energy) will be inevitable. There is no avoiding this.

So, in order to facilitate this, we need to start building the infrastructure to accommodate this new future, now. Cars will be mostly charged at home, so we need to support this, chargers in apartment buildings need to be mandatory. We also need to start supporting charging stations between towns. Give incentives for regional tourism operators (that exist between towns) to also install them. Have fast chargers every 50-100km between towns. Have multiple fast chargers in regional towns. The main road through a small town thats filled with shops and cafes? Perfect, fill it with fast chargers. Larger charging stations on the entrances to towns. Great opportunity to install local batteries and solar for the towns as well.

As people rightly point out, the current 300-400km range isn't enough for some people. However, it is enough for the vast majority of people, so we should be making it easier for them to transition to EV's. Over the years, range will improve, to a point where they can travel further then conventional vehicles, so the people who do need the longer range will then be able to transition and the supporting infrastructure will already exist!",2021-05-30 11:41:12.500456,

Give everyone the next 4 days, to get all they need to lockdown for 21 days. Stay home. The only available services will be garbage pick up, law enforcement, medical rescue, hospital, and fire response. You can only leave your home to take out the trash, and take the dog to pee/poop. No food delivery, no postal, no online orders delivered. Nothing, nada, zilch, zero. People who work for medical, trash, emergency, fire, etc. will be escorted to and from work, via law enforcement. So no need to gas up your auto. Do note, that this list does not include, workers, if! Your electrical or water grid goes down. Your internet or tv service goes down. Shut down all flights, ships or what ever in and out of your country.

MORRISON FOOLING THE PUBLIC INTO BLAMING THE STATES
.
Victoria's current seven day lockdown (From Thursday 27th May 2021) is linked to the Playford Hotel in Adelaide which again supports the claim that the real problem is quarantine.

These so called Medi-Hotels used for quarantine are not fit for purpose because of poor ventilation and this latest breach is the 19th such breach that's happened in a quarantine hotel during this covid pandemic.

The virus isn't being effectively contained during quarantine which has allowed the new highly infectious strain. the Indian variant, to spread like wildfire. In two days this cluster has gone from 2 to 45.

Quarantine is being mishandled by the Federal government and unless they fix the problem, states like Victoria and all the other states, will be forced into lockdown every time Australia's quarantine system fails.

Another lockdown coming your way soon ..

Discrimination should be taken seriously. But articles like this, with such broad stats and no analysis (just an unsubstantiated

You might as well publish an article on how men (based purely on prison numbers and lengths of sentences) are systemically discriminated against by the courts. Or do an article against Uber because female employees earn an average 7% less.

She's pure bred BC from a long line of farm sheep workers. We live on a wheat farm and she's never worked stock in her life although there's no question she'd be excellent at it. She's 100% free no fences. Inside at night. Sleeps with me. She would never dream of playing up, chewing anything, grabbing a chicken. Got zero behaviour problems whatsoever. Because she has all her requirements met easily in a normal life.
Whatever breed you have if you can't give it at least a walk a day, except when there's a raging blizzard, then you shouldn't have a dog. That's the most simplistic solution to 90% of ""behaviour problems"". Every canine behaviour problem is a human problem.
I LOVE what this guy is doing. What a fantastic thing. But the idea that the dog is doing this that and the other because it needs to herd stock is ridiculous. Hopefully many of the owners learn more about what they should be doing, than what their dog should be doing. There is no such thing as a dog that needs sheep to be happy. The dog does not know it's a sheep dog. It's been selectively bred for a strong prey drive with obedience and high intelligence. The dog is actually hunting. Under human control. We use its natural instincts for our benefit.
All it needs is walk, play, family. EVERY day. Like any dog. Doesn't need the actual sheep. Just needs its fundamental canine needs met. Hunt (walk) Chase and kill (play). Feast (eat). Social structure (part of the family not banished to a corner of a yard).
Every breed. That's the formula for a happy well behaved dog. All that gets in the way is the excuses for why we can't provide that.",2021-05-29 16:45:42.852936,

MadeFather and Son Welfare MovementAustral
iaOceania1961
The Father and Son Welfare Movement of Australia was founded in 1926 with the aim of providing authoritative sex education for young people as well as marriage and family guidance. In the years between 1954 and 1956 it issued its first set of nine sex education guides and its output since then has been prolific. In 1969 alone its sale of sex education books exceeded 1.5 million copies (in a country whose population was less than 12 million). It also produced recordings and sent out speakers to schools and organisations that requested them. For many young Australians it provided their only contact with any sort of informed sex education.

This week at the conversation
""The greatest inter-generatio
nal injustice ever inflicted by one generation of humans upon the next""
Over the 15 or so years I’ve been writing and editing articles on environmental issues, every now and then a friend or acquaintance will, in hushed tones, lean over and divulge a secret. They don’t read about climate change. It’s not that they don’t care – of course they do. But amid the maelstrom of work and kids and life stuff, keeping on top of the climate crisis is all a bit too much – too complicated, too guilt-inducing,
too depressing.
I completely get it. Sometimes I can’t bring myself to read the articles either. But next time a friend makes that confession, I will point them to the one article, published by The Conversation this week, I’d recommend they read.
It involves a class action brought against Environment Minister Sussan Ley by a group of young people, acting on behalf of all Australian children and teenagers.
Their bid to prevent a coal mine expansion did not succeed. But the Federal Court nonetheless made a historic ruling: the environment minister owes a duty of care to Australia’s young people not to cause them harm from climate change.
The finding was ground-breaking
enough. But it was this moving excerpt from the written judgment by Justice Mordy Bromberg that really cut to the bone:
""It is difficult to characterise in a single phrase the devastation that the plausible evidence presented in this proceeding forecasts for the children. As Australian adults know their country, Australia will be lost and the world as we know it gone as well.
The physical environment will be harsher, far more extreme and devastatingly brutal when angry. As for the human experience – quality of life, opportunities to partake in nature’s treasures, the capacity to grow and prosper – all will be greatly diminished.
Lives will be cut short. Trauma will be far more common and good health harder to hold and maintain.
None of this will be the fault of nature itself. It will largely be inflicted by the inaction of this generation of adults, in what might fairly be described as the greatest inter-generatio
nal injustice ever inflicted by one generation of humans upon the next.
To say that the children are vulnerable is to understate their predicament.""
The no-holds-barred
statement brought tears to the eyes of hardened lawyers, not to mention many other watchers of the case. National debate over Australia's climate policies often centres on the short-term social and economic implications. The consequences for future generations of today's inaction is often overlooked.
In fact, we can now put a dollar figure on those consequences. An independent expert witness in the court case conservatively calculated the cost of climate change to today's young people at between A$125,000 and A$245,000 per person. The estimate took into account property loss, reduced earnings and other economic impacts. And frighteningly, the expert found one in five of today’s children will likely be hospitalised due to heat stress in their senior years.
So where does all this leave us? Clearly, rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are sorely needed. In Australia, such measures are deeply polarising, but they needn’t be. The best solutions will come from finding common ground – working out what we all care about, and building from there. Surely leaving a habitable planet for today’s children, and others to come, is something most of us would agree is paramount.
And while reading about climate change is quite often hard, the court case this week revealed one big positive. A formidable generation of young climate advocates has well and truly arrived – demanding action, and inspiring hope.

“the idea of reparations is frightening not simply because we might lack the ability to pay. The idea of reparations threatens something much deeper – America’s heritage, history and standing in the world.”

Same goes for the rest of the colonisers - yet the support is growing for this to be done, and it's only fair that it should be.

Germany has refused to use the word reparation and some groups of Herero and Nama people ,who have been promised to be those who primarily benefit from German ‘ aid’ have not been consulted in the process. This negotiation process has already taken 5 years. Germany has acknowledged that they committed genocide in Namibia, so reparation should follow as soon as possible, not over 30 years. I certainly hope the Namibian people whose ancestors suffered and died during colonisation will get justice .

OBSOLETING THE PERFECTED IMMUNE SYSTEM will in the process destroy it, but nothing works faster, as immune system starts day one and beats a virus fully by 2 weeks, it takes far longer to await a vax and die in droves until a vax is created and likely not perfected. Yes our immune does not create clots like the vax is creating and those who fought it and gained natural immunity are more protected than vax on trial. The media needs to start taking more responsibility than to just promote all the govt and pharma spin, as reporters at risk also.",2021-05-30 14:54:13.009028,

Thats why he regrets and feels bad about the past. He has kept her in your lives and you've been supportive of it.
I only read the artical as i could believe the gall of him to actually suggest it. But even by your own words you've enabled this way of thinking. You should never have been with him in the first place, you kept her memory an active part of your lives. I think you did so not because you understood grief, but you wanted to keep him.

There is a child arriving soon and you should not start out by asking 500,000 strangers is it okay to give our baby an ex girlfriend's name . What strangers think really does not matter.

But the relationship was over, doesn't matter who ended it, this happens to a lot of people and you have to accept it, I know he didn't want to end it as much as she did but it ended. As for his ex dieing 2 months later well that's very sad but after 2 year's he sounds like he can't let her go. Even though he has another girlfriend who is now having his child I think it's wrong of him to want to call his baby his ex name even for middle name.

#FreePalastine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Israel had annexed all of Area C – some 60% of the West Bank, where the hundreds of Israeli settlements have been placed – decades ago. The settlements are, without exception, situated on stolen Palestinian land; the settlers enjoy all the privileges of Israeli citizens – they vote in the elections, have health insurance and social security, come before Israeli civil courts if need be, are connected to the Israeli electricity and communications grid and to the Israeli water suppliers, and they are protected at every step by Israeli soldiers and police. Their settlements are surrounded by security fences, and they can call in the army whenever they feel like it, for example, to harass Palestinian shepherds or farmers. The army takes its orders directly from the settlers, as I have seen in practice endless times.

Palestinians living in Area C – several hundred thousand people – have no rights at all. They are disenfranchised
; their lands, homes, and other possessions can be taken from them at any moment; they can be assaulted and even killed by settlers, usually with impunity; and they are subject to military courts which convict over 99% of Palestinians who have the misfortune to come before them. Not to put too fine a point on it: Israel has created and maintained a system all too akin to that of South Africa at the height of the apartheid days. A Jewish ethnic elite totally dominates a helpless non-Jewish population confined to small, discontinuous, Bantustan-like enclaves surrounded by the settlements.
The idea that Israel can destroy the Palestinian national movement once and for all is a pipe-dream of the Israeli right; it has no basis in reality. The notion that coercive force alone, the Israeli default, will solve our problems is no less foolish. Israel is not China, not Russia, indeed not anyone but a rather tiny state on the Mediterranean coast, albeit one armed to the teeth. The Jewish and Palestinian population west of the Jordan River is now at parity. There is no way that six or seven million Israeli Jews can enslave seven to eight million Palestinians forever.

What was wrong with the mother taking the time off work? What gave her the goddamn right to tell him what he was doing and make the rules?
All too many times the parent with the most custody thinks they can rule the roost
And it should not be the case, the kids are humans and not a possession, allow them, to a point, to have their own say..
Oh n before u all jump on the band wagon, I am a single mum.
Yes I despise my nasty ex but if my kids want to see their father. I take them to see their father.
Not really an issue anymore as he loves alcohol & substance more than anything and never contacts my kids and they’ve stop contacting him, but if they said tomorrow “hey mum I want to see dad” I’d still take them to see him.
Sometimes the relationship between mum n dad is tumultuous at best and sometimes making a point with certain actions is the only way.
I say if she wants to think of him as a babysitter, pay up. Or stay home herself.",2021-05-30 07:00:18.339201,

Our business (Garage Doors) can not pivot to “click and collect” or take away. Installs, repairs, services and quotes are predominantly done at occupied residential properties- this can not be actioned on-line.

During ALL these state enforced lock downs we have not been eligible for a single dollar from the state government.

NOT $1!!!!

Federal government has failed in security of quarantine.
Federal government has failed in the rollout of vaccine.
But the state government has also failed its duty with contact tracing.
The state government has failed in the handling of outbreaks.

The state government has failed all Victorian business, especially small business who have not been eligible for assistance by their specific prerequisites. Which is beyond my understanding as to why they are picking and choosing only certain industries to support for grants and/or assistance.

Both Federal and State governments have failed and we continue to bare the brunt of this recklessness. 😡",2021-05-30 14:00:54.926580,

The total number of active cases in New Zealand today is 16 and the total number of confirmed cases is 2316.

The Ministry also confirmed that the initial estimate of 500 travellers who flew from Melbourne airport to New Zealand between 20-25 May has been revised down to 4626 people.

""These 4626 travellers are being contacted by email and instructed to get a test and self-isolate at home or in the accommodation they are staying in until they have a negative result.""

It said it still needed to contact 89 of the 4626 travellers.

""Efforts are ongoing to contact these people to ensure they are isolating and being tested.""

Almost half of identified travellers have now been tested and returned a negative result. An update on numbers tested will be provided tomorrow.

""The Melbourne cluster reinforces the critical importance of everyone keeping a record of where they have been by scanning QR codes or keeping a manual diary of their movements. It can help contact tracers quickly find potential close and casual contacts if there is a positive Covid-19 case in New Zealand.""",2021-05-30 15:52:29.071331,

Anyway, you’re not even the sign you think you probably are because astrology is based on an ancient idea of a fixed sky that never changes. Wrong. Because of the Earths wobble...the precession of the equinoxes...the
zodiac is now about one star sign out, and no longer lines up with the fixed dates of the star signs.
Grow up people. Use it for a bit of harmless fun when you read your star sign in the paper, but if you’re basing life decisions on what your zodiac says, you’re being deluded.

No. It is not one women every week: it is every 9 days.

And in 2021 the rates are similar between men and women.

A guy walks into a Melbourne bar - he’s just back from India, does 14 days quarantine in Adelaide, passes that, and wanders the streets of Adelaide then flys to Melbourne AND THEN the 🦠 that was on him all that time suddenly appears and starts spreading, and causes the complete lockdown of 6.5 million people for at least 7 days.

No one else in Adelaide quarantine or working there gets it, no one else in Adelaide anywhere gets it and no one else on the plane gets it.
But he gets to his home in Melbourne and SHAZAM, it takes off and shuts the whole state down.
And all this happens days before the State of Emergency runs out in Victoria.
And the reason for a lockdown, according to the govt, is that not enough people are “jab*ed”.
But they get to extend the State of Emergency because of this sudden and mysterious outbreak that only happened AFTER the guy left quarantine and flew to Melbourne and mixed amongst his family.
And the people of Victoria rush out in unprecedented numbers to join the global human test**g and trial of the j*b currently being marketed by govt as a ‘ennicav’ - even though it’s not actually a ‘ennicav’ and even with possible long term ramifications not being known for a long time, (many years to come) of course.

Yet Bailey Scott had 14 touches (""not trying"") to Hill's 6 touches (trying).
Without even looking at the obvious of disposal differences, Hill gets beaten 1v1 95% of the time. He is a sheepdog player and can only get disposals with near zero pressure.

Rattan you're making excuses, bad excuses, he needs to be dropped because you are not doing Hill, the players, the club or yourself any favors.

Alan Richardson had the same philosophy and Rattan is heading towards the same door.",2021-05-30 10:05:16.556346,
